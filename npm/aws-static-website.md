## About

A Github Action Workflow that builds a static website from a Javascript project using NPM and then synchronizes the distribution directory to an S3 bucket.

This workflow requires the arn of a CICD role that can be assumed in order to synchronize a local directory to the specified S3 bucket. Follow the [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) to setup an OpenID provider on AWS and configure an IAM role that can be assumed by that provider. The role must have the following policy attached, where `${bucket_name}` should be the same as the value for the `bucket_name` input.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3Access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket_name}/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket_name}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
